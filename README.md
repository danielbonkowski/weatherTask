# Weather

This app was created for the purpose of showcasing data manipulation
based on a sample hardcoded JSON object. The app presents temperatures
in 4 cities.

## The main tasks for this project were to:

* Decode given JSON to models
* Find the smallest temperature across all cities and print it
* For each city find its highest temperatures and print the results in format "city: max_temp"
* Find the city with the smallest average daily temperature and print its name
* Show JSON data as a list in the Android app

## How to use the application?

The app doesn't require any additional configuration.
It requires API level 19 (Android 4.4 - Kitkat) or higher.
